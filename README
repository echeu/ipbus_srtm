This code is used in conjuction with the ironman framework to communicate with the SRTM via ipbus

Usage: python3 ipbus_srtm.py

Notes:
Calls write_reg.exe (in /home/root/ipbus) to write register values. The python mmap function appears to write to the register twice.

To build write_reg.exe, just do

  make
